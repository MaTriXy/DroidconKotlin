To mitigate the risk of malicious apps, there is a need for an automated system to detect these applications. Current detection techniques rely on the signatures of well-documented malware, and hence may not be able to detect new malware samples. The majority of these approaches are based on either the analysis of complex features extracted from the files present in Android executables (e.g., DroidSafe) or dynamic features derived from an app's behaviour during runtime. Extraction of such complex features is a tedious task and requires a considerable amount of time and system resources. With rapid increase in the amount and complexity of malware, it is beneficial to employ methods that do not rely on analysis of complex features and are time efficient. In this session, we will speak about an alternative solution. Instead of focusing on individual malware samples, we propose to turn our attention to malware developers. The benefit of this strategy is clear: generating a signature for malware developer rather than individual malware sample, we can effectively characterise all malware samples generated by a particular software developer. The primary premise for our work stems from authorship attribution field, typically used in literary domain. Author attribution domain assumes that each author possesses a unique writing style which can accurately identify his/her works among others. Our hypothesis is that a developer similar to an author has a unique programming style which is reflected through the various components of programs developed by him. By analysing such program components, we can possibly generate the author\u2019s signature that can uniquely identify applications developed by that author. One of the simplest components that can represent an author\u2019s writing style is a set of strings used by a developer throughout binary code. Various string components such as variables, class names, method names, and string literals reflect the writing preferences of the developer. We present an approach to identify an author of an given Android application using the author's signature (profile) comprised of different string components that can potentially reflect the Android author's style. Using these author signatures, we can effectively detect a wide range of existing, as well as any new, malware samples generated by particular authors.\r\n", "isServiceSession": false, "endsAt": "2019-05-02T15:45:00", "isPlenumSession": false, "startsAt": "2019-05-02T15:00:00", "title": "Android malware forensics", "roomId": 3423, "id": "66176", "categories": [], "room": "Fisher East"}, {"speakers": [{"id": "4069d809-60df-47f4-90e2-9b912576adf1", "name": "Ben Dodson"}, {"id": "1258496a-abb3-4acb-bf5d-f5388691e498", "name": "Gustavo Moura"}], "description": "Over the last 5 years, the Snapchat application rapidly became more and more feature rich.

To mitigate the risk of malicious apps, there is a need for an automated system to detect these applications. Current detection techniques rely on the signatures of well-documented malware, and hence may not be able to detect new malware samples. The majority of these approaches are based on either the analysis of complex features extracted from the files present in Android executables (e.g., DroidSafe) or dynamic features derived from an app's behaviour during runtime. Extraction of such complex features is a tedious task and requires a considerable amount of time and system resources. With rapid increase in the amount and complexity of malware, it is beneficial to employ methods that do not rely on analysis of complex features and are time efficient. In this session, we will speak about an alternative solution. Instead of focusing on individual malware samples, we propose to turn our attention to malware developers. The benefit of this strategy is clear: generating a signature for malware developer rather than individual malware sample, we can effectively characterise all malware samples generated by a particular software developer. The primary premise for our work stems from authorship attribution field, typically used in literary domain. Author attribution domain assumes that each author possesses a unique writing style which can accurately identify his/her works among others. Our hypothesis is that a developer similar to an author has a unique programming style which is reflected through the various components of programs developed by him. By analysing such program components, we can possibly generate the author\u2019s signature that can uniquely identify applications developed by that author. One of the simplest components that can represent an author\u2019s writing style is a set of strings used by a developer throughout binary code. Various string components such as variables, class names, method names, and string literals reflect the writing preferences of the developer. We present an approach to identify an author of an given Android application using the author's signature (profile) comprised of different string components that can potentially reflect the Android author's style. Using these author signatures, we can effectively detect a wide range of existing, as well as any new, malware samples generated by particular authors.\r\n", "isServiceSession": false, "endsAt": "2019-05-02T15:45:00", "isPlenumSession": false, "startsAt": "2019-05-02T15:00:00", "title": "Android malware forensics", "roomId": 3423, "id": "66176", "categories": [], "room": "Fisher East"}, "id": 3423, "name": "Fisher East"}, {"index": 3, "session": {"speakers": [{"id": "35ef5dc9-243d-49c5-b1fe-807d7983a673", "name": "Ben Schwab"}], "description": "In the past three years Airbnb's Android App has evolved from a monolithic single application project to having over 100 feature modules and 20 build variants.
