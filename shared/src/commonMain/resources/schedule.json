We'll also venture into image processing techniques and discuss their implementation in Compose. With practical examples, we'll gain a deeper understanding of the creative coding landscape and acquire tools that can be applied to enhance UX or simply have fun exploring new artistic realms!\r\n",

We saw that our applications had a lot of components that could be abstracted away as simple APIs in Compose, which made it easier to keep our design consistent across our domain. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will talk about how we started this initiative and how we set up the architecture for our design system. Then, I will explain a robust approach when creating components as atoms & molecules and how this helps us to collaborate with the designers in our teams. Moreover, I will be going through how we ensured banking-level quality for our compose components and which technologies we use today to make it easier for our developers to work with these libraries. Then, I will touch upon the release and dependency management of these libraries, and how we introduced this to our developers. In the end, I will be discussing the challenges and learnings for creating a component library with Compose.\r\n\r\nJoin me in this session, where we will explore the beauties of library development with Jetpack Compose!\r\n",

In this talk we show you how build scans can help save a lot of time when you need to find build performance bottlenecks, investigate/troubleshoot CI failures, build/tool chain failures, visualize your dependencies, etc. to troubleshooting/investigating build issues and accelerate your builds/tests.\r\nFrom this session you will learn…\r\n- Can I make my build faster? Build performance profiling with a simple UI: what are all the performance bottlenecks in my build, how well is my build cache working, the impact of heap, garbage, dependency downloads on my build times.\r\n- How well is my build parallelized? Can I get more parallelization to speed up my builds?\r\n- What's happening in my build? View the build timeline view to see what tasks/goals are being executed in which order. You can use this to see how well parallelized is your build\r\n- Git and CI integration for better workflow. Go from your CI job to your build scan and back. Go to the Git source repo, git commit id, show me all the builds on this git commit id\r\n- Troubleshoot CI failures way faster with a build scan by viewing failed taks/goal in consol log. Build scans pull out all the details pertaining to your failure out of the consol log so you don’t have to parse through thousands of lines of logs\r\n- Dependency Search: view, search through your projects dependencies and their versions in a few clicks\r\n- Triage Test failures: The test dashboard sorts your projects test failures by failure count with a nice UI. With a few clicks you can see which test classes failed the most, sort by your longest tests, test methods with the most test failures, link to your test report\r\n- Tool chain and build related failures: What’s breaking my build?",

We will then outline the common issues that developers encounter when using Gradle build cache. These issues include incorrect build cache settings, conflicts with the build cache, and incorrect configurations.\r\n\r\nNext, we will provide solutions to these issues. We will discuss how to configure the build cache settings correctly to ensure optimal performance. We will also explain how to resolve conflicts that arise when multiple developers work on the same project.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we will discuss how to optimize the Gradle build cache for large-scale Android projects. We will provide tips on how to manage the cache for multi-module projects and how to set up a distributed cache for teams working on a shared project.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this presentation provides a summary to common Gradle build cache issues in Android development. By understanding the issues and implementing the solutions presented in this talk, developers can optimize their build process and improve the overall efficiency of their development workflow.\r\n",

            "description": "Mobile release cycles can be slow, leading to delays in feature launches and user feedback. This can be especially problematic for features that require multiple iterations to tweak UI, logic, and other elements. To address this issue, Uber developed a highly opinionated, type-safe, and interoperable Server-Driven Technology framework that allows teams to adopt it easily without rebuilding every aspect of their feature.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will discuss the importance of the right guardrails, ensuring the right versioning, the dangers of the framework getting misused, and the need for robust testing mechanisms. We will also explore how we support multiple use cases for different features and teams in a generic way across multiple apps at Uber.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave with a deep understanding & practical knowledge of building a robust  Server-Driven framework and accelerating mobile development. By sharing our experiences at Uber, we hope to inspire other organizations to embrace Server-Driven Technologies and accelerate their mobile development cycles.\r\n",

It established a simple design system that enabled developers to apply universal styling patterns to create pleasing UI with minimal effort. Material has evolved throughout the years. The newest generation of the standard is named Material You, and is integrated directly with Jetpack Compose. It is a natural complement to writing Kotlin code, and is the perfect dynamic design system for all Android, Web, and Desktop apps. \r\n\r\nThis session will be an introduction to design systems. I will discuss how you can apply color, typography, and dimension standards across your Applications universally. This results in a UI that is easy to refactor, aesthetically pleasing, and can be made a11y compliant. Using Material, I will explain fundamental aspects of design that will empower developers to feel more confident about UI, and enable better communication with designers.\r\n",

            "description": "The need for security in mobile apps has never been greater. Most developers are aware of the need to encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit; but how do you protect the cryptographic keys that unlock the data? This presentation will examine the solutions available - from hardware-backed options like the Android Keystore to pure software ones like Whitebox Cryptography. It will look at the pros and cons of the different solutions and highlight the use cases each is best suited to with real world examples.",

This has, historically, been a sensible prioritization. Faire’s two-sided marketplace is composed of generally high-intent users. Since we can assume a higher level of tolerance for latency for high-intent users, we’ve often dismissed the importance of performance. However, industry research has shown that one-second delay in response can result in a 7% loss in conversion. With that in mind, Faire set out to improve our app speed. In this talk we will cover how we approached improving our app speed (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Contro), what tools and techniques we used, our progress towards our goals and our next planned steps.\r\n",

            "description": "Separation of concerns is a common best practice followed by all successful software projects. In Android applications, there is usually a UI layer, a data layer, and a domain layer. Given the infinite number of ways to implement these layers, it's not clear how to get started quickly. Therefore, many projects follow Google's high-level guide to app architecture, which suggests many reasonable defaults and best practices. But how do the proposed recommendations work in practice? How do you set up an architecture that is ready for your use cases with this guide in mind? Are suggestions such as using Hilt as the backbone for your architecture really a good recommendation?\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss best practices for taking ownership of your own architecture, decoupling your business logic from Android components, and creating and managing scopes for your use cases. There will be concrete advice on how to loosely couple classes in the data and domain layers, how to prevent memory and thread leaks, and how to adopt the dependency injection framework of your choice.

In this talk you’ll learn how to get the fastest possible Gradle performance by avoiding the network latency tax.\r\n\r\nIf your build times have crept up enough, modularizing your Gradle project and setting up a remote build cache can lead to 90% reduction in execution time. However, in reality, cache performance is heavily influenced by network latency. High latency is often a consequence of data traveling long distances. For a geographically distributed team, cache performance will vary significantly. Some developers will even see build time regressions. \r\n\r\nJoin this talk to learn about the Build Cache CDN, a pragmatic strategy for mitigating the network latency tax on the cache and achieving the fastest build performance.",

However, as with any technique, there are pros and cons to using mocks.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss why using mocks may not be the best approach and why we should instead use fakes or in-memory implementations of well-defined interfaces. We will explore the drawbacks of mocks, including how they can lead to brittle tests, slow down development, and make it difficult to refactor code.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, we will see how using fakes or in-memory implementations can provide faster feedback, increase confidence in the code, and make it easier to maintain tests as the codebase evolves. We will look at some examples of how to implement these alternatives, and how to make them useful in different testing scenarios.",

In fact, in the tech sector, it's difficult to miss discussion about how the jobs of today will inevitably be impacted by GPT-3.5 and, recently, GPT-4. With the arrival of Microsoft 365 Copilot and the massive amount of GitHub data Microsoft has used to train it, it's evident that OpenAI's large language models will also transform the software development process. In this discussion, Sofy CEO and founder Syed Hamid will share a variety of use cases that provide insight into how this technology is changing today's software testing landscape. Syed will also discuss how Sofy has harnessed the power of GPTs to further amplify Sofy's revolutionary no-code mobile app testing approach.",

              "description": "Mobile release cycles can be slow, leading to delays in feature launches and user feedback. This can be especially problematic for features that require multiple iterations to tweak UI, logic, and other elements. To address this issue, Uber developed a highly opinionated, type-safe, and interoperable Server-Driven Technology framework that allows teams to adopt it easily without rebuilding every aspect of their feature.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will discuss the importance of the right guardrails, ensuring the right versioning, the dangers of the framework getting misused, and the need for robust testing mechanisms. We will also explore how we support multiple use cases for different features and teams in a generic way across multiple apps at Uber.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave with a deep understanding & practical knowledge of building a robust  Server-Driven framework and accelerating mobile development. By sharing our experiences at Uber, we hope to inspire other organizations to embrace Server-Driven Technologies and accelerate their mobile development cycles.\r\n",

              "description": "Separation of concerns is a common best practice followed by all successful software projects. In Android applications, there is usually a UI layer, a data layer, and a domain layer. Given the infinite number of ways to implement these layers, it's not clear how to get started quickly. Therefore, many projects follow Google's high-level guide to app architecture, which suggests many reasonable defaults and best practices. But how do the proposed recommendations work in practice? How do you set up an architecture that is ready for your use cases with this guide in mind? Are suggestions such as using Hilt as the backbone for your architecture really a good recommendation?\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss best practices for taking ownership of your own architecture, decoupling your business logic from Android components, and creating and managing scopes for your use cases. There will be concrete advice on how to loosely couple classes in the data and domain layers, how to prevent memory and thread leaks, and how to adopt the dependency injection framework of your choice.

We saw that our applications had a lot of components that could be abstracted away as simple APIs in Compose, which made it easier to keep our design consistent across our domain. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will talk about how we started this initiative and how we set up the architecture for our design system. Then, I will explain a robust approach when creating components as atoms & molecules and how this helps us to collaborate with the designers in our teams. Moreover, I will be going through how we ensured banking-level quality for our compose components and which technologies we use today to make it easier for our developers to work with these libraries. Then, I will touch upon the release and dependency management of these libraries, and how we introduced this to our developers. In the end, I will be discussing the challenges and learnings for creating a component library with Compose.\r\n\r\nJoin me in this session, where we will explore the beauties of library development with Jetpack Compose!\r\n",

              "description": "The introduction of Material Design was one of the more exciting things to happen to Android in years. It established a simple design system that enabled developers to apply universal styling patterns to create pleasing UI with minimal effort. Material has evolved throughout the years. The newest generation of the standard is named Material You, and is integrated directly with Jetpack Compose. It is a natural complement to writing Kotlin code, and is the perfect dynamic design system for all Android, Web, and Desktop apps. \r\n\r\nThis session will be an introduction to design systems. I will discuss how you can apply color, typography, and dimension standards across your Applications universally. This results in a UI that is easy to refactor, aesthetically pleasing, and can be made a11y compliant. Using Material, I will explain fundamental aspects of design that will empower developers to feel more confident about UI, and enable better communication with designers.\r\n",

There are good reasons to migrate sooner, rather than later, though:\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you'll learn how the flexibility offered by BillingClient 5 enables new paywall configurations and functionality, with working examples for you to implement yourself. We'll also highlight the challenges we ran in while upgrading the RevenueCat library to support these changes, many of which are incredibly relevant if you're one of the hundreds of thousands of Android apps that still need to migrate away from PBL4 or even 3.\r\n\r\nYou'll leave the talk with a better understanding of real-world implementations of Billing Library 5, its benefits and its challenges, setting you up for a more successful migration down the road.\r\n\r\nDepending on this year's I/O, we'll update this talk with examples and insights pulled from PBL6 as they become available\r\n",

In this talk you’ll learn how to get the fastest possible Gradle performance by avoiding the network latency tax.\r\n\r\nIf your build times have crept up enough, modularizing your Gradle project and setting up a remote build cache can lead to 90% reduction in execution time. However, in reality, cache performance is heavily influenced by network latency. High latency is often a consequence of data traveling long distances. For a geographically distributed team, cache performance will vary significantly. Some developers will even see build time regressions. \r\n\r\nJoin this talk to learn about the Build Cache CDN, a pragmatic strategy for mitigating the network latency tax on the cache and achieving the fastest build performance.",

In this talk we show you how build scans can help save a lot of time when you need to find build performance bottlenecks, investigate/troubleshoot CI failures, build/tool chain failures, visualize your dependencies, etc. to troubleshooting/investigating build issues and accelerate your builds/tests.\r\nFrom this session you will learn…\r\n- Can I make my build faster? Build performance profiling with a simple UI: what are all the performance bottlenecks in my build, how well is my build cache working, the impact of heap, garbage, dependency downloads on my build times.\r\n- How well is my build parallelized? Can I get more parallelization to speed up my builds?\r\n- What's happening in my build? View the build timeline view to see what tasks/goals are being executed in which order. You can use this to see how well parallelized is your build\r\n- Git and CI integration for better workflow. Go from your CI job to your build scan and back. Go to the Git source repo, git commit id, show me all the builds on this git commit id\r\n- Troubleshoot CI failures way faster with a build scan by viewing failed taks/goal in consol log. Build scans pull out all the details pertaining to your failure out of the consol log so you don’t have to parse through thousands of lines of logs\r\n- Dependency Search: view, search through your projects dependencies and their versions in a few clicks\r\n- Triage Test failures: The test dashboard sorts your projects test failures by failure count with a nice UI. With a few clicks you can see which test classes failed the most, sort by your longest tests, test methods with the most test failures, link to your test report\r\n- Tool chain and build related failures: What’s breaking my build?",

You'll learn what you need to get a clear understanding of how all folks in the *very* heterogeneous Android ecosystem are experiencing your app. That way, you can tailor your app to enhance everyone's user experience and drive growth for all segments and device cohorts.\r\n\r\nSuggested tags: Observability, App Performance, Performance Metrics, User Growth",

              "description": "In software development, mocking is a popular technique used to simulate dependencies and test behaviour without relying on external systems. However, as with any technique, there are pros and cons to using mocks.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss why using mocks may not be the best approach and why we should instead use fakes or in-memory implementations of well-defined interfaces. We will explore the drawbacks of mocks, including how they can lead to brittle tests, slow down development, and make it difficult to refactor code.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, we will see how using fakes or in-memory implementations can provide faster feedback, increase confidence in the code, and make it easier to maintain tests as the codebase evolves. We will look at some examples of how to implement these alternatives, and how to make them useful in different testing scenarios.",

We will then outline the common issues that developers encounter when using Gradle build cache. These issues include incorrect build cache settings, conflicts with the build cache, and incorrect configurations.\r\n\r\nNext, we will provide solutions to these issues. We will discuss how to configure the build cache settings correctly to ensure optimal performance. We will also explain how to resolve conflicts that arise when multiple developers work on the same project.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we will discuss how to optimize the Gradle build cache for large-scale Android projects. We will provide tips on how to manage the cache for multi-module projects and how to set up a distributed cache for teams working on a shared project.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this presentation provides a summary to common Gradle build cache issues in Android development. By understanding the issues and implementing the solutions presented in this talk, developers can optimize their build process and improve the overall efficiency of their development workflow.\r\n",

This has, historically, been a sensible prioritization. Faire’s two-sided marketplace is composed of generally high-intent users. Since we can assume a higher level of tolerance for latency for high-intent users, we’ve often dismissed the importance of performance. However, industry research has shown that one-second delay in response can result in a 7% loss in conversion. With that in mind, Faire set out to improve our app speed. In this talk we will cover how we approached improving our app speed (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Contro), what tools and techniques we used, our progress towards our goals and our next planned steps.\r\n",

In fact, in the tech sector, it's difficult to miss discussion about how the jobs of today will inevitably be impacted by GPT-3.5 and, recently, GPT-4. With the arrival of Microsoft 365 Copilot and the massive amount of GitHub data Microsoft has used to train it, it's evident that OpenAI's large language models will also transform the software development process. In this discussion, Sofy CEO and founder Syed Hamid will share a variety of use cases that provide insight into how this technology is changing today's software testing landscape. Syed will also discuss how Sofy has harnessed the power of GPTs to further amplify Sofy's revolutionary no-code mobile app testing approach.",

Store has been simplifying data loading on Android for close to a decade and was supercharged by being 100% Kotlin.  Today we're here to talk about the next paradigm shift in data loading Store5 - a Kotlin Multiplatform solution for reading, writing and resolving data conflicts on any platform that Kotlin supports (Android, iOS, Web and Desktop). The Android community has embraced Store for close to a decade, Kotlin is making it possible to adopt the same patterns on other mobile platforms and beyond.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of support for updating remote sources, network resilience, pain free conflict resolution, and a highly extensible api - Store5 aims to make reading and writing data effortless on all Kotlin platforms. This talk will focus on Store5 foundational concepts and usage in production and at scale. We will be covering adopting KMP, applying Google's offline-first guiding principles beyond Android and how we hope to establish a seamless way for all apps, regardless of platform, to work with local and remote data. This talk is not to be missed for folks (like us) who have battle scars from years of working on hard to fix bugs in offline first applications.\r\n",

            "description": "At Uber, we support thousands of developers contributing to Android code. If builds are rapid, and stable, developer productivity is high.\r\n\r\nYou’re working on a new mobile feature. It’s taken you weeks. You’ve been running your tests on CI. Your manager is asking you if you’ll hit the deadline. You feel confident, so you say yes. The day comes when you need to land your code. You try to merge it, but everyone’s merging code on the same day. Your code fails to merge, and your feature is delayed. Everyone is frustrated. We’ve all been there before. \r\n\r\nKeeping developer productivity high with our monorepo and thousands of developers is what we do at Uber. In my presentation, I will be discussing how you can do seamless mobile code merges at scale. \r\n\r\nThese are some of the key points I will be talking about: \r\n- Pre merge validation\r\n- Post merge validation\r\n- Cache freshness\r\n- Parallelism/sharding\r\n- Merge queue optimizations\r\n- Optimizing for cost vs performance\r\n- Success metrics\r\n",

If a library malfunctions and causes an outage, it may take days or weeks to get it solved for all your users. Apps have long update cycles and don’t have the luxury of hotfixes when something goes wrong. At Uber, as an app that people rely upon for making their income, getting to the doctor, or commuting to work, reliability in our app is the top priority. Learn how Uber decides when mobile libraries are safe to include and when they should be avoided.\r\n\r\nWe’ll review how Uber analyzes external libraries to reduce risk, walk through some horror stories when things went wrong, and discover some techniques that can help keep reliability for your user when the worst does happen. You’ll walk away with a tactical framework for evaluating libraries in your own apps.",

            "description": "App size reduction should be a critical aspect of app development, and is especially necessary for end users who may have restricted device storage or limited data plans. However, it can be challenging for developers—especially those working with multiple contributing teams—to manage and visualize app size throughout the development flow. \r\n\r\nUsing the major telecom company app, Xfinity, as an example, we will take a deep dive into how to optimize app size. This app illustrates the complexities of size management: the app is used across the world in both high- and low-resourced contexts, requires multi-language support, and draws visual assets from regional partners.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will address the following tools and techniques, many of which have been used in the Xfinity development flow, and are broadly applicable to other development projects:\r\nImage compression: Using lossless compression with modern formats (.webp, vector graphics)\r\nUnused code and assets: Implementing code shrinkers (Google’s R8)\r\nModularizing app delivery: Dividing the app into smaller modules, downloaded on-demand as per user needs (Google’s Dynamic Feature Delivery)\r\nStrings: Improving string usage, including considerations for localization\r\nAnalysis: Monitoring app size throughout the development process\r\n",

            "description": "\r\nAbstract:\r\nIn recent years, location-based apps have become an integral part of the Android ecosystem. However, as user privacy concerns continue to rise, Google has made several changes to the location permission model in Android. This session will explore the evolution of location permission in Android, from install time permission to runtime permission and beyond. We will dive deep into the location permission break up of foreground and background, and the challenges posed by UI/UX design for asking permissions in a contextual way.\r\nSession Description:\r\nIn the early days of Android, developers had to request location permission during the installation process. Users had to either grant permission for location access or not install the app altogether. However, this model was not user-friendly and left users feeling uneasy about granting location permission to all apps.\r\nTo address this issue, Google introduced the concept of runtime permission, allowing users to grant or deny location permission to an app when they are using it. This improved user privacy and control over location access, but it also introduced new challenges for developers, including permission handling in the background.\r\nAs part of this session, we will discuss the location permission break up of foreground and background, and its impact on the development of location-based apps. We will explore the UI/UX challenges of asking permission in a contextual way, including best practices for designing permission requests that provide clear and concise information about why the permission is needed and how it will be used.\r\nAttendees of this session will gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of location permission in Android, as well as insights into the current state of location permission management. This session is suitable for developers of all levels and will provide valuable information for anyone working on location-based apps for Android.\r\nKey takeaways:\r\nThe evolution of location permission in Android\r\nLocation permission break up of foreground and background\r\nUI/UX challenges for asking  permissions in a contextual way\r\nBest practices for designing permission requests",

In this talk, I will demonstrate how you can employ tactics in your Gradle builds that will have your polyrepo behaving more like a monorepo. Many of these strategies can even be applied to  monorepos as well. In this session, you will gain insight into:\r\n- Building convention plugins to standardize all aspects of your builds including versioning, releasing, changelogs, static analysis, test configurations, and build optimizations\r\n- Maintaining published version catalog artifacts for both your internal and external dependencies so teams can easily keep up to date on available libraries and their latest version\r\n- Set up configurable, composite builds so you can develop your libraries as if it was another module in your main application build, shortening the feedback loop that comes with publishing to maven local.\r\n- Leveraging Renovate to automate keeping all your repos up to date on the latest code",

Maybe you’ve even integrated some shared code into a production app. If you have, you know that there are many subtle complications that come up when you want to ship shared Kotlin code. This includes things like modularization, translating between Kotlin and Swift, managing multiple repositories that depend on each other, and optimizing build times and binary sizes. It’s not as easy as it looks when you write your first “Hello World”!\r\n\r\nAt Touchlab, we’ve been involved with Kotlin Multiplatform since the very beginning, and we’ve learned a thing or two along the way about what does and doesn’t work well. Come hear about how we’ve solved some of these difficulties to ship Multiplatform code across all sorts of organizations and environments, so you’re ready to use KMP in the real world.",

A lot of Compose features are based on a runtime library that doesn't require any compiler support: the snapshot system. It might seem like magic at first, but it's just built on top of things you might already know: ThreadLocals, linked lists, and, yes, even regular old callbacks. Once you understand how Compose thinks about state, you might find ways to use its tools in your own code – even outside of Compose.\r\n",

I will show how AppCompat Library replaces resources, recreates the whole activity stack, syncs locales, etc.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the experience is not the same for all Android versions, which we should keep in mind. I am eager to share my experience and suggest my solution for discussion and how I was able to unify it.\r\n\r\nTo spice it up, I have my story of ups and downs, which is quite entertaining and, at the same time, useful for the audience; how I broke the app for Indonesian users because of locales.",

In this talk, we will share our experience of how we tackled this challenge at YML by using a centralized Github Actions approach.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss how we created reusable workflows that can be easily shared across all the repositories, reducing the need to maintain multiple pipelines. We will also cover the various checks that we execute for each repository, such as unit tests, integration tests, and code quality checks. These checks help us to catch issues early and ensure that we are always release-ready.\r\n\r\nBy using a centralized Github Actions approach, we have been able to streamline our build and release process, reduce the time and effort required to maintain multiple pipelines, and ensure that our code quality remains consistent across all the repositories. \r\n\r\nJoin us to learn more about this approach and how it can benefit your organization.",

Maybe you’ve even integrated some shared code into a production app. If you have, you know that there are many subtle complications that come up when you want to ship shared Kotlin code. This includes things like modularization, translating between Kotlin and Swift, managing multiple repositories that depend on each other, and optimizing build times and binary sizes. It’s not as easy as it looks when you write your first “Hello World”!\r\n\r\nAt Touchlab, we’ve been involved with Kotlin Multiplatform since the very beginning, and we’ve learned a thing or two along the way about what does and doesn’t work well. Come hear about how we’ve solved some of these difficulties to ship Multiplatform code across all sorts of organizations and environments, so you’re ready to use KMP in the real world.",

Store has been simplifying data loading on Android for close to a decade and was supercharged by being 100% Kotlin.  Today we're here to talk about the next paradigm shift in data loading Store5 - a Kotlin Multiplatform solution for reading, writing and resolving data conflicts on any platform that Kotlin supports (Android, iOS, Web and Desktop). The Android community has embraced Store for close to a decade, Kotlin is making it possible to adopt the same patterns on other mobile platforms and beyond.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of support for updating remote sources, network resilience, pain free conflict resolution, and a highly extensible api - Store5 aims to make reading and writing data effortless on all Kotlin platforms. This talk will focus on Store5 foundational concepts and usage in production and at scale. We will be covering adopting KMP, applying Google's offline-first guiding principles beyond Android and how we hope to establish a seamless way for all apps, regardless of platform, to work with local and remote data. This talk is not to be missed for folks (like us) who have battle scars from years of working on hard to fix bugs in offline first applications.\r\n",

A lot of Compose features are based on a runtime library that doesn't require any compiler support: the snapshot system. It might seem like magic at first, but it's just built on top of things you might already know: ThreadLocals, linked lists, and, yes, even regular old callbacks. Once you understand how Compose thinks about state, you might find ways to use its tools in your own code – even outside of Compose.\r\n",

              "description": "\r\nAbstract:\r\nIn recent years, location-based apps have become an integral part of the Android ecosystem. However, as user privacy concerns continue to rise, Google has made several changes to the location permission model in Android. This session will explore the evolution of location permission in Android, from install time permission to runtime permission and beyond. We will dive deep into the location permission break up of foreground and background, and the challenges posed by UI/UX design for asking permissions in a contextual way.\r\nSession Description:\r\nIn the early days of Android, developers had to request location permission during the installation process. Users had to either grant permission for location access or not install the app altogether. However, this model was not user-friendly and left users feeling uneasy about granting location permission to all apps.\r\nTo address this issue, Google introduced the concept of runtime permission, allowing users to grant or deny location permission to an app when they are using it. This improved user privacy and control over location access, but it also introduced new challenges for developers, including permission handling in the background.\r\nAs part of this session, we will discuss the location permission break up of foreground and background, and its impact on the development of location-based apps. We will explore the UI/UX challenges of asking permission in a contextual way, including best practices for designing permission requests that provide clear and concise information about why the permission is needed and how it will be used.\r\nAttendees of this session will gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of location permission in Android, as well as insights into the current state of location permission management. This session is suitable for developers of all levels and will provide valuable information for anyone working on location-based apps for Android.\r\nKey takeaways:\r\nThe evolution of location permission in Android\r\nLocation permission break up of foreground and background\r\nUI/UX challenges for asking  permissions in a contextual way\r\nBest practices for designing permission requests",

              "description": "Managing the build and release process for over 25 Android repositories can be a daunting task. With each repository having its own pipeline or workflow, it can become difficult to ensure consistency and quality across all the repositories. In this talk, we will share our experience of how we tackled this challenge at YML by using a centralized Github Actions approach.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss how we created reusable workflows that can be easily shared across all the repositories, reducing the need to maintain multiple pipelines. We will also cover the various checks that we execute for each repository, such as unit tests, integration tests, and code quality checks. These checks help us to catch issues early and ensure that we are always release-ready.\r\n\r\nBy using a centralized Github Actions approach, we have been able to streamline our build and release process, reduce the time and effort required to maintain multiple pipelines, and ensure that our code quality remains consistent across all the repositories. \r\n\r\nJoin us to learn more about this approach and how it can benefit your organization.",

If builds are rapid, and stable, developer productivity is high.\r\n\r\nYou’re working on a new mobile feature. It’s taken you weeks. You’ve been running your tests on CI. Your manager is asking you if you’ll hit the deadline. You feel confident, so you say yes. The day comes when you need to land your code. You try to merge it, but everyone’s merging code on the same day. Your code fails to merge, and your feature is delayed. Everyone is frustrated. We’ve all been there before. \r\n\r\nKeeping developer productivity high with our monorepo and thousands of developers is what we do at Uber. In my presentation, I will be discussing how you can do seamless mobile code merges at scale. \r\n\r\nThese are some of the key points I will be talking about: \r\n- Pre merge validation\r\n- Post merge validation\r\n- Cache freshness\r\n- Parallelism/sharding\r\n- Merge queue optimizations\r\n- Optimizing for cost vs performance\r\n- Success metrics\r\n",

If a library malfunctions and causes an outage, it may take days or weeks to get it solved for all your users. Apps have long update cycles and don’t have the luxury of hotfixes when something goes wrong. At Uber, as an app that people rely upon for making their income, getting to the doctor, or commuting to work, reliability in our app is the top priority. Learn how Uber decides when mobile libraries are safe to include and when they should be avoided.\r\n\r\nWe’ll review how Uber analyzes external libraries to reduce risk, walk through some horror stories when things went wrong, and discover some techniques that can help keep reliability for your user when the worst does happen. You’ll walk away with a tactical framework for evaluating libraries in your own apps.",

              "description": "App size reduction should be a critical aspect of app development, and is especially necessary for end users who may have restricted device storage or limited data plans. However, it can be challenging for developers—especially those working with multiple contributing teams—to manage and visualize app size throughout the development flow. \r\n\r\nUsing the major telecom company app, Xfinity, as an example, we will take a deep dive into how to optimize app size. This app illustrates the complexities of size management: the app is used across the world in both high- and low-resourced contexts, requires multi-language support, and draws visual assets from regional partners.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will address the following tools and techniques, many of which have been used in the Xfinity development flow, and are broadly applicable to other development projects:\r\nImage compression: Using lossless compression with modern formats (.webp, vector graphics)\r\nUnused code and assets: Implementing code shrinkers (Google’s R8)\r\nModularizing app delivery: Dividing the app into smaller modules, downloaded on-demand as per user needs (Google’s Dynamic Feature Delivery)\r\nStrings: Improving string usage, including considerations for localization\r\nAnalysis: Monitoring app size throughout the development process\r\n",

In this talk, I will demonstrate how you can employ tactics in your Gradle builds that will have your polyrepo behaving more like a monorepo. Many of these strategies can even be applied to  monorepos as well. In this session, you will gain insight into:\r\n- Building convention plugins to standardize all aspects of your builds including versioning, releasing, changelogs, static analysis, test configurations, and build optimizations\r\n- Maintaining published version catalog artifacts for both your internal and external dependencies so teams can easily keep up to date on available libraries and their latest version\r\n- Set up configurable, composite builds so you can develop your libraries as if it was another module in your main application build, shortening the feedback loop that comes with publishing to maven local.\r\n- Leveraging Renovate to automate keeping all your repos up to date on the latest code",
