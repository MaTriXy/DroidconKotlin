        "description": "Modern mobile and Android are a touch over 15 years old. Droidcon NYC 2024 is in its 10th year. Will we all look at some pictures? Of course! Maybe hear a few tips on running a conference.\r\n\r\nThen, it’s time to look forward.\r\n\r\nTech trends come and go. Some burn hot, then disappear. Some become essential. The web is essential. Mobile is essential. Whatever happens with mobile technology, the idea that mobile won’t be as, or more essential, 15 years from now is nonsense.\r\n\r\nHow mobile is developed and delivered is a different question altogether. This will be a talk about near-term tech possibilities, but not what mobile might look like in 15 years. I could speculate, and I'd be wrong. It will be a talk about how this community can shape that future, starting now.\r\n\r\nWhile the tech hype machine has hopped from one shiny concept to another, neither the web nor mobile has remained static. Far from it. We’re in a moment of change and opportunity. A very special moment for this community specifically. But the community is necessary to take advantage of it.",

One of the heavyweight optimizations we call the \"baseline kotlin cache\". As we all know, normally, any changes to a low-level module will make the parent module cache fingerprint change invalid. We solved this problem by turning the fuzzy cache of the compileKotlin task into an incremental record bin, and reducing the full build time of the TikTok app in any scenario to 50%!  Those solutions from TikTok could help Kotlin module build 2x+ faster than it used to be. ",

After all, it can potentially save a business millions of dollars by cutting down duplicate iOS and Android code and saving many developer hours. \r\n\r\nBut when you have large, complicated codebases and investment in a mobile organization with specific skill sets, it can be an expensive decision to put time and resources into shifting into KMM instead. It can be a hard decision to reverse, and a risky call to make. But it doesn't have to be!\r\n\r\nIn this talk I’ll lay out a decision-making framework to approach KMM adoption - not just from an engineering perspective, but a leadership one too. We’ll reference case studies and talk about: \r\n\r\n* Evaluating KMM for different kinds of projects - standard mobile codebases as well as those in custom frameworks like RIBS and Workflow\r\n* The important factors - build  support for Android vs iOS, resourcing KMM expertise, and flexibility, all of which impact long-term risks and outcomes\r\n* Evaluating cultural support - what kind of teams and organizations are best set up for KMM success? \r\n* Finding the right engineering levers to make adoption more successful\r\n \r\nAt Square, I’ve had to make that call for my team, and I’ve worked with other teams that faced similar decisions. I’ll reference real learnings as we discuss wisely and successfully steering a team into new Kotlin waters. \r\n",

This works: we fixed thousands of leaks (in our apps, third-party libraries, and the Android Framework), and we're now finding fewer and fewer new leaks!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we sometimes see the heap size grow over time without LeakCanary finding any issue. For example, constantly appending string logs to a collection would not trigger LeakCanary but would still lead to ANRs and OOMEs when the app eventually runs out of memory.\r\n\r\nInspired by the BLeak paper and the work of the Android Studio team, I built a new toolkit in LeakCanary that performs repeated heap dump diffs and detects objects with a constantly increasing number of outgoing edges (for example, a list that keeps growing).\r\n\r\nCome learn how this works; together, we can fix all the leaks!",

        "description": "For most companies, developer tooling investments often lag behind direct user-facing codebase improvements. However, as a company grows, more engineers begin to contribute and the codebase gets more complex and mature, tooling becomes an essential part of maintaining and improving the developer experience at scale.  Early tooling efforts often evolve into disparate collections of multilingual scripts, but what happens when we treat tooling and infra as a proper software project just like we would production code? Let’s explore how Reddit has made tooling a first-class citizen within our codebase by leveraging custom IntelliJ IDE Plugins to improve the developer experience and how your team can apply these concepts and learnings to your own projects.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways: \r\n1. What is an IntelliJ Plugin and how can it help you build tooling to level-up your developer experience?\r\n2. What kinds of problems can IntelliJ plug-ins help solve, with Reddit-specific examples:\r\n    a. Use Case: Using plugins to improve developer onboarding\r\n    b. Use Case: Using plugins to keep developers informed and up-to-date\r\n    c. Use Case: Using plugins to accelerate large migrations\r\n    d. Use Case: Using plugins to reinforce opinionated design patterns\r\n3. What are some other opportunities for plug-ins and how to get started writing your own or leveraging those from others\r\n",

In order to both obtain functional clarity, and abstraction from platform level implementation.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, there have been options available specific to each platform, and even options part of the platform framework itself. Though it can be difficult to find the right option for platform-agnostic code, ensuring consistency. Some go one step further, providing an opinionated guide on how to architecture your application.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll evaluate the options available, how they differ, and to what type of applications they are best suited. Including how to get started with them, and the best practice guidelines on how to get the most out of them, for your application.",

Maybe you’re migrating existing apps to multiplatform, maybe you have platform-specific libraries or APIs you want to interact with, or maybe your platforms need to do slightly different things.\r\n\r\nThe strength of Kotlin on every platform is not just sharing code, but also interop with the platform’s unique APIs. When building multiplatform apps, it pays to think not only about what code can be shared, but also about what code is better not shared, and how to move between them.\r\n\r\nUsing examples drawn from real-world projects, we’ll look at different strategies for architecting the shared and not-shared parts of your codebase, so you’re better prepared to handle those times when a platform-specific solution is the best one.",

        "description": "Have you ever wondered how the slot table is implemented in Compose? How are groups generated? What's the magic behind skipping, and how can you peek inside a slot table? The Slot table implementation was updated recently for performance. This talk takes a deep dive into the Jetpack Compose compiler internals, with a special focus on answering these questions and exploring the implementation details of the slot table. We'll go beyond the basics, uncovering how the compiler is structured and tested. This knowledge will empower you to understand, contribute to, or even build your own tools on top of it. Whether you're a curious developer or aspiring plugin contributor, get ready to fully understand the Jetpack Compose Compiler.",

While many engineers aspire to reach these higher echelons, few truly understand the profound shift in responsibilities that accompany such roles. Misalignment in expectations can lead to significant struggles in these new positions, especially for specialists like mobile engineers, who face unique hurdles when advancing beyond senior roles without broadening their expertise.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will demystify the path to post-terminal levels, using Uber as a case study. We will outline what it takes to operate at these advanced stages, setting realistic expectations, and providing actionable examples and recommendations for those aiming to climb the career ladder. The discussion will also address the specific challenges faced by specialized engineers and propose strategies to overcome them.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave equipped with practical tools to steer their career growth, a clearer understanding of the dynamics at higher levels, and a refined perspective on their long-term career objectives.\r\n",

        "description": "In early times of Android development we used to have big activities. All view and business logic were being written in activities. Then fragments were introduced so that activities started to become leaner. Then several architectural patterns have started to appear in the Android scene: MVP, MVVM, MVI, etc. While all these were happening, ViewModel like classes started to get bigger and bigger. They have become the new big activities. However, we haven't often considered splitting view models into manageable self-contained granular ones.\r\n\r\nViews are composable and they can be composed to build bigger views. What about introducing smaller ViewModels, namely UI models, and using them to build composable UI models/View Models?  \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will introduce the micro-feature architecture that leverages granular UI models. We'll demonstrate how this approach enables us to create leaner UI hosts by breaking down view models into smaller, self-contained logical UI models. Moreover, we'll explore the distinctions between a UI model and a Jetpack ViewModel. \r\n\r\nWe'll delve into the advantages offered by micro-feature architecture, particularly in terms of single responsibility, composability, reusability, and testability. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how adopting this architecture can significantly enhance your development process and empower you to build high-quality, scalable applications which has highly dynamic contextual screens. \r\n\r\nMicro-feature architecture is used in several screens of 2 big apps in production which are now being used by 10M+ users. We will be also sharing our learnings about using this approach in these apps. ",

We’ll discuss the results of our preliminary performance benchmarks. We’ll explore new concepts like an “updating item” for independent updates and an “operation pipeline” for on-the-fly data transformations, setting StoreX apart from traditional paging libraries.\r\n\r\nThe talk will cover StoreX Paging’s core APIs and customization points, including launch effects, middleware, side effects, and adaptive fetching strategies. We’ll share implementation details of our default fetching strategy and Compose Runtime integration, demonstrating how we’ve optimized memory management for large datasets. Finally, we’ll discuss performance benchmarking approaches and real-world applications of StoreX Paging at TikTok.",

        "description": "Let's face it: as developers, we dedicate a third of our time to code maintenance, which includes tasks such as upgrading dependencies, addressing security vulnerabilities, and removing obsolete code. This is tedious and repetitive. Neglecting regular maintenance can lead to costly outcomes, including unexpected crashes and it makes the codebase more difficult to understand and evolve.\r\n\r\nHowever, automation of these tasks is not always straightforward. Existing tools such as security scanners, feature flag systems warn you about the issues or obsolete code but fall short of automatically rectifying these problems. Tools that upgrade dependencies merely increase the version number, leaving engineers to handle any API compatibility issues. Automating code changes is hard, and the polyglot nature of modern development makes it harder.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will delve into code rewriting techniques such as pattern matching, program analysis, and AI. We will illustrate how we leveraged the complementing power of these tools to generate over 1800  automated pull requests, eliminating or refactoring more than 500,000 lines of code. In this talk, you will also learn how to harness the power of these tools to drive down tech debt, ensuring your apps are not only functional but also future-proof.",

Understanding the underlying mathematics and modeling techniques is crucial for camera developers to optimize performance, correct imperfections, and deliver exceptional image quality. The Camera2 API exposes many of these details and developers would benefit significantly by knowing how to work with them.\r\n\r\nThis talk will delve into :\r\n  - Camera intrinsics and extrinsics, which describe the geometric relationship between the camera and the scene.\r\n- Lens distortion correction using the Brown-Conrady model.\r\n- Meaning of various maps exposed in the Camera2 API such as hot pixel map, lens shading map\r\n- and more\r\n\r\nTarget Audience:\r\n\r\nAndroid developers seeking to build or enhance camera-centric applications. Especially those who are building apps seeking to use cameras on Android to understand the world around them, eg: AR based apps\r\n\r\nTakeaways:\r\nBy the end of the talk you will have a good understanding of the mathematical models needed to process images captured by your Android device's camera and use them for innovative applications. \r\n\r\n",

Let’s take a closer look at what the team at JetBrains has done to get here, and have an exclusive look at the subjects we’re getting ready as we move toward a stable release!\r\n\r\nThat includes the ecosystem – well-established Jetpack libraries such as Navigation, ViewModel, DataStore, Lifecycle, and even Room are now available in Kotlin Multiplatform projects. Through practical examples, we’ll explore how building well-architected cross-platform apps with Kotlin is easier than ever.\r\n\r\nIn multiple live demos, we’ll see how the new common APIs can be used in practice, how they fit smoothly into Compose Multiplatform, and how they integrate naturally with iOS. We’ll also see some of the tooling improvements we at JetBrains are making around previews, common resources, and more.\r\n\r\nCompose Multiplatform brings your established skill set to new platforms. And it’s ready for you to start building – on iOS, Android, and beyond!",

How can we factor these uncertainties into the productivity gains we get from the tools? What if a 30% productivity gain is as good as we get? I will cover the promises, the realities, and the current/future states of Generative AI. We will acknowledge the unmovable realities getting in the way of the unstoppable fantasies, and help you separate the benefits from the grift.",
