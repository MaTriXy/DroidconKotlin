This talk is going to draw corollaries between API design and video game design, and we're all going to learn from the greatest game design in the game on how to be friendly to newcomers. It's simpler than you think, but doing it right is challenging. We'll use open source examples and talk about how we've used this strategy at CashApp to great effect.\r\n\r\nIt's super effective!",

Furthermore, you\u2019ll be able to use familiar components such as LiveData or RxJava to interface with your existing architecture.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you\u2019ll learn:\r\n- how to integrate the PagedList component into your architecture\r\n- how to implement a DataSource to load snapshots when necessary\r\n- how to use BoundaryCallback to signal the end of available data\r\n- how to integrate LiveData or RxJava to fit your project",

Both share many similarities and as both platforms has been converging, barriers to become fluent on native mobile apps for Android and iOS are lower than ever!. Join us to see an Android developer doing Swift, an iOS developer writing Kotlin and enjoy this thrill ride with two tour guides that will drive you out of your comfort zone while sharing their struggles and success to inspire you to learn the languages. In this talk we'll review similarities and advantages as we  implement an app on both platforms, how to start using the other language once you've given your first steps on either and how you can start your world domination plans with your next line of code.

It can even load another app\u2019s code, and execute it.  All this happens without leaving the device, without classic reverse-engineering tools on a developer machine.  \r\n\r\nI\u2019ll walk through the APIs that expose your resources, and show how to put them into action.

So let's try to shift the balance by talking about a better, calmer way.\r\n\r\nWe'll talk about a variety of ways we can all encourage greater calm at work. How do we maintain focus and prevent interruptions? What are some strategies to manage our time and responsibilities? What can we do both at work and home to keep me sharp mentally? And how do maintain real balance and boundaries between work and home?\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, I hope you'll have some new ideas and inspiration to work toward a calmer, more productive work environment for you and your team.",

Then, by connecting it to CI, we\u2019ll enforce our contract to keep our platforms on speaking terms.\r\n\r\nThe examples in this talk will be from Sprout, an internal library in development at Etsy.  The Sprout Kotlin DSL is the seed that generates code for many platforms: Retrofit endpoints, Moshi models, Swift, PHP, and more.  We\u2019ll look at how to use Kotlin as a templating language, and how the DSL can even generate itself.  Finally we\u2019ll peek at the future potential of these types of DSLs.

Swift has been following its own path to success the last couple of years. Both share many similarities and as both platforms has been converging, barriers to become fluent on native mobile apps for Android and iOS are lower than ever!. Join us to see an Android developer doing Swift, an iOS developer writing Kotlin and enjoy this thrill ride with two tour guides that will drive you out of your comfort zone while sharing their struggles and success to inspire you to learn the languages. In this talk we'll review similarities and advantages as we  implement an app on both platforms, how to start using the other language once you've given your first steps on either and how you can start your world domination plans with your next line of code. Quack quack!",

Does Kotlin provide operator overloading? What does the `reified` keyword do? I want to write a DSL, how does it work?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we want to dive into some advanced features of the language. We learn about concepts like reified generic types, lambdas with receiver, DSLs, built-in delegation, infix functions, operator overloading, destructuring, inline classes, and more. The talk will make you feel more comfortable about what Kotlin does internally and why functions in the standard library \"just work\". You will learn to make use of advanced features to get even more productive with the language.",

The two work together flawlessly to help you build world class distributed systems.\r\n\r\nAt Square, client and server engineers collaborate on Protobuf schemas to define APIs. We also built Wire - a library which processes schemas and generates Java code that applications can use to send and receive data. Last year we started working on Wire 3, which is rewritten in Kotlin, generates Kotlin code, and adds a number of exciting features:\r\n\r\n- Protobuf messages as data classes\r\n- Multiplatform runtime module\r\n- Coroutines-based gRPC APIs\r\n- Gradle plugin\r\n\r\nIn this session, we\u2019ll take a deep dive into these features, and talk about how we leveraged Kotlin to create better APIs. We\u2019ll show you how to get the best out of Protobuf and gRPC for your server and client applications using Wire.\r\n",

The Google Assistant on the other hand, the past year quadrupled its active users and it's now available in more than a billion devices. While this number constantly grows, during this years IO we saw a next gen Assistant that is smart, helpful, extremely fast, but most importantly a part of the OS instead of an add-on. From showing notifications and information when asked, to opening apps and complete the action there, the Assistant can get things done faster and better than ever. How do you make sure your content is visible to the Assistant and consequently to your users? How do you make your app \"Assistant ready\"? In this talk we're going to explore among others the brand new app actions and slices for the Assistant, how you can make your own action, while we're also going to touch on some app architecture basics",

Android development has changed significantly during the time. Kotlin release versions used to have M-notation, now we live in a Kotlin first world, and everyone is waiting on kapt. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of modularization are well known in the community. But what are the steps to get there? In this talk, we will briefly cover our app architecture, and the motivation behind the initial effort in 2016, and how we got to an app with over 300 modules. Then we will dive into several modularization strategies where we started getting immediate benefit of a drastically reduced feedback loop. \r\n\r\nBut the road paved with good intentions might lead you to hell. Through many many bumps, crashes and accidents on the road, those strategies have been evolved to answer many open questions we weren\u2019t sure about initially. How can Dagger help with separation of concerns? How granular each module should be? Where is the glue to stitch everything together? And finally, has build speed actually improved? Join Aaron and Siggi from Android Platform team at Tinder to learn a few things about modularization!",

The talk will make you feel more comfortable about what Kotlin does internally and why functions in the standard library \"just work\". You will learn to make use of advanced features to get even more productive with the language.",

At Uber, we decided to look at how we can improve indexing performance for projects with a lot of modules. In this talk, Naveen will go over the various performance issues that we discovered with Intellij and our Android codebase. He will dive deep into how we developed \u201cUber Focus\u201d to significantly improved Intellij\u2019s performance using lazy indexing.

While there are plenty of resources on how to use this feature, this session takes a look at converting a real-world Java Swing Application to Kotlin Multiplatform and when it actually makes sense to use it.\r\n\r\nStarting from with the basics of Kotlin Multiplatform, you will get to see its\r\nbeauty and simplicity. After that, you will learn about gotchas, caveats and\r\nlessons learnt from converting and refactoring a Java Desktop Application to Kotlin and running it on multiple target platforms. In this talk, we will take a look at running our refactored code in the browser.\r\n\r\nYou'll leave this talk with a solid grasp of what's possible with Kotlin\r\nMultiplatform, where it makes sense to use it and where it maybe doesn't.",

Now that we have these tools it is time to give users the beautiful motion they've come to expect from top tier apps.\r\n\r\nWe will cover how to practically use MotionLayout to deliver on complex design asks. This will involve reusing Constraints between multiple Transitions, how to apply multiple effects at different points in a Transition, switching between Transitions programmatically or automatically, how to link the progress of MotionLayout to other widgets, and especially how complex interactions with a RecyclerView can be straightforward.\r\n\r\nWhether you're a senior UI developer who knows the intricacies of Animators or someone who has shied away from animation on Android, this talk should give you a working knowledge of how MotionLayout can make a difference in your app and team.",

Android development has changed significantly during the time. Kotlin release versions used to have M-notation, now we live in a Kotlin first world, and everyone is waiting on kapt. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of modularization are well known in the community. But what are the steps to get there? In this talk, we will briefly cover our app architecture, and the motivation behind the initial effort in 2016, and how we got to an app with over 300 modules. Then we will dive into several modularization strategies where we started getting immediate benefit of a drastically reduced feedback loop. \r\n\r\nBut the road paved with good intentions might lead you to hell. Through many many bumps, crashes and accidents on the road, those strategies have been evolved to answer many open questions we weren\u2019t sure about initially. How can Dagger help with separation of concerns? How granular each module should be? Where is the glue to stitch everything together? And finally, has build speed actually improved? Join Aaron and Siggi from Android Platform team at Tinder to learn a few things about modularization!",
